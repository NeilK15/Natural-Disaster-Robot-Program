# Natural-Disaster-Robot-Program

A program I created for ENES 100 a Young Scholars course at the University of Maryland that I took over the summer of 2019. The program controlled a robot 
I created using an arduino, 2 motors, a motor controller, two ultrasonic sensors, a temperature sensor, and an lcd screen. 

The program tells the robot to follow a wall with the side mounted ultrasonic sensor and the PD controller implemented in the code. The robot will be able
to make turns and keep a relative distance with the wall on its left. 

The robot was designed to be a prototype disaster relief robot that could navigate through a site that may have been hit by a tornado or any other natural
disaster. It is equipped with a temperature sensor and the code implements the sensor to detect and measure the tempeture in the site to determine if the
site is safe for humans to enter.
